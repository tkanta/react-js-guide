I fix this just deleting:

"eslintConfig": {
  "extends": [
    "react-app",
    "react-app/jest"
  ]
}
on package.json




@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object
------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object?activeTab=code
This plugin transforms checks for a private property in an object


One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.
